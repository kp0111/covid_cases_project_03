Certainly! Here's a descriptive summary of the project showcasing COVID-19 cases using various types of charts and graphs:
Project Overview: Visualization of COVID-19 Cases in Different States

This project aims to visually represent the COVID-19 cases reported in various states during May and June 2020 using Python's Matplotlib library for data visualization.

1. Bar Chart: Comparison of COVID Cases (May-2020 and June-2020)**
- A bar chart is utilized to compare the number of COVID-19 cases reported in different states during May and June 2020.
- The chart displays side-by-side bars for each state, with different colors representing cases in May and June respectively.

2. Pie Chart: Share of States in Positive Cases (May-2020)**
- A pie chart illustrates the proportional distribution of COVID-19 cases among states during May 2020.
- The state with the highest number of cases is visually emphasized by exploding its slice from the pie chart.

3. Line Chart: Comparison of Cases (May-2020 and June-2020) for Different States**
- Line charts present the trend of COVID-19 cases in May and June 2020 for selected states.
- Each state is represented by a different colored line, showing the change in cases over these two months.

4. Subplot: Line, Pie, and Bar Charts for June-2020 Cases**
- Subplots are employed to display multiple charts in a single figure for June 2020.
- It includes a bar chart showing cases in June for each state, a line chart comparing cases in June for selected states, and a pie chart exhibiting the share of states in positive cases for June.

5. Pie Chart: Share of Cases - Top 4 States vs Other States (June-2020)**
- This pie chart highlights the collective share of COVID-19 cases in the top 4 states compared to all other states in June 2020.
- The top 4 states' contributions are individually labeled, while the rest of the states are grouped as 'Other.'

These visualizations serve to provide a comprehensive understanding of how COVID-19 cases were distributed among states during May and June 2020, showcasing comparisons, trends, and relative contributions of different regions to the overall case count.
